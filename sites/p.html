		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Of the places detailed in this project, the Fishermen's Hall is the only building which is extant, and for that reason, is the only site whose exact location can be definitively identified. Built in 1860-1861, the Fishermen's Hall is one of the few buildings in the down-town core of St. John's which escaped the Great Fire of 1892.  One possible reason for this is that the building is made from stone, and the majority of buildings destroyed in fire were made of wood and so burned easily and quickly.  This fact was not lost on the people of St. John's and the rebuilding of the downtown which followed the Great Fire was focused on the use of stone or brick instead of wood, in order to avoid such quick destruction in future times.</p>

         <h3>Research</h3>
         <p><b>Fishermen's Hall</b></p>
         <p>The preservation of the Fishermen's hall is extraordinary, given its historical context, and in 1985 it received the Southcott Award for Building Restoration/Preservation, given by the Newfoundland and Labrador Historic Trust.</p>
         <p>The Fishermen's Hall was originally built as an exhibition hall for fisheries and agricultural produce. It also became a popular location for other social events, including dances, lectures, and theatre, and was even used as a Catholic place of worship and as the Sisters of Mercy Catholic school.</p>
         <br>
         <p><b>Professor Danielle</b></p>
         <p>Charles Henry Danielle, known as 'Professor Danielle' was a colourful and eccentric character about whom little is known prior to his arrival in St. John's in 1860.  Born November 1st, 1830 in Baltimore, Maryland, Danielle was a self-advertised 'professor' of the Tarsichorean art and the owner of a successful Chicago dance academy.</p>
         		          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xtina-R/daea/gh-pages/images/newdanielle.png" style="float:right; padding-left:35px">
         		          <p>After arriving in St. John's, he advertised himself as a dance instructor and costume-maker, and quickly developed a reputation of glamour and mystery. He leased the downtown building known as the Victorian Skating Rink, and from there hosted fancy-dress balls and parties, and elaborate carnivals and theatrical productions which show-cased his costumes.  Danielle left St. John's rather suddenly in 1865, following a fire (purportedly started by an enemy) which destroyed the property, including his collection of costumes, which he insured for thousands of dollars.</p>
         		          <p>Danille returned to St. John's on May 30th, 1888, and once again commenced to host his popular carnival and parties. He also ran a successful restaurant on Water Street which was destroyed in the fire of 1892. He died on May 1st, 1902, in the 'Octagon Castle' (his elaborate, eight-side home near Irvine, Newfoundland), and was buried in the Anglican cemetary on the shores of Quidi Vidi Lake, a small body of water (visible on the map) located to the South-West of St. John's.</p>
         <p><b>T.M. Brown</b></p>
         <p>Nothing further could be found on T.M. Brown. While Brown appears to have been a relatively common name in the area, no records fitting the combination of initials and last name of this man could be located.</p>
